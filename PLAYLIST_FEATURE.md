# Playlist Feature Implementation

## Overview

The playlist feature has been successfully implemented for the multitrack player app. This feature allows users to create, manage, and play playlists of songs sequentially. All playlist data is scoped to individual user profiles and stored in Firebase Realtime Database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Data Models** (`src/types/playlist.ts`)
- `Playlist`: Main playlist interface with metadata, songs, and user ownership
- `PlaylistItem`: Individual songs in a playlist with position and metadata
- Form interfaces for creating, updating, and managing playlists

### 2. **Playlist Service** (`src/services/playlistService.ts`)
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `createPlaylist()`: Create a new playlist
  - `getUserPlaylists()`: Get all playlists for a user
  - `getPlaylist()`: Get a specific playlist by ID
  - `updatePlaylist()`: Update playlist metadata
  - `deletePlaylist()`: Delete a playlist
  
- **Song Management**:
  - `addSongToPlaylist()`: Add a song to playlist
  - `removeSongFromPlaylist()`: Remove a song from playlist
  - `reorderPlaylist()`: Reorder songs in playlist
  - `getPlaylistSongs()`: Get full song data for playlist items

- **Real-time Updates**:
  - `subscribeToPlaylist()`: Listen to playlist changes
  - `subscribeToUserPlaylists()`: Listen to all user playlists

### 3. **Playlist Player Service** (`src/services/playlistPlayerService.ts`)
- **Playback Controls**:
  - `loadPlaylist()`: Load a playlist for playback
  - `play()`: Play current song
  - `pause()`: Pause playback
  - `stop()`: Stop and reset playback
  - `next()`: Go to next song
  - `previous()`: Go to previous song
  - `goToSong()`: Jump to specific song in playlist
  - `seekTo()`: Seek to position in current song

- **Playback Modes**:
  - `toggleShuffle()`: Enable/disable shuffle mode
  - `toggleRepeat()`: Enable/disable repeat mode

- **Event Callbacks**:
  - `onSongChange`: Triggered when song changes
  - `onPlaylistEnd`: Triggered when playlist finishes
  - `onStateChange`: Triggered on player state changes
  - `onError`: Triggered on errors

### 4. **Playlist UI** (`src/components/PlaylistScreen.tsx`)
- **Main View**:
  - List of user's playlists
  - Playlist metadata (name, song count, last updated)
  - Quick actions: Play, View Details, Delete

- **Create Playlist Modal**:
  - Name (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Public/Private toggle

- **Playlist Details Modal**:
  - View all songs in playlist
  - Drag-to-reorder (position-based)
  - Remove songs
  - Add songs button

- **Add Songs Modal**:
  - Browse available songs
  - Add songs to playlist with one tap

### 5. **Navigation Integration** (`src/app/index.tsx`)
- Added `playlists` screen to app navigation
- Navigation handler `handleNavigateToPlaylists()`
- Integrated with existing navigation flow

### 6. **HomePage Integration** (`src/app/HomePage.tsx`)
- Imported playlist services and types
- Added playlist state management
- Playlist player initialization with callbacks
- Ready for UI integration (playlist button can be added to header)

### 7. **Database Rules** (`database.rules.json`)
- Added `playlists` node with authentication rules
- User-scoped read/write access

## Data Structure

### Firebase Database Structure
```
playlists/
  {playlistId}/
    id: string
    name: string
    description: string (optional)
    userId: string
    songs: [
      {
        id: string
        songId: string
        songTitle: string
        songArtist: string
        position: number
        addedAt: ISO date string
        notes: string (optional)
      }
    ]
    createdAt: ISO date string

### For Developers

#### Creating a New Playlist
```typescript
import PlaylistService from '../services/playlistService';

const playlistService = PlaylistService.getInstance();

const newPlaylist = await playlistService.createPlaylist(userId, {
  name: 'My Playlist',
  description: 'My favorite songs',
  isPublic: false
});
```

#### Adding Songs to Playlist
```typescript
await playlistService.addSongToPlaylist(playlistId, {
  songId: song.id
}, song);
```

#### Playing a Playlist
```typescript
import PlaylistPlayerService from '../services/playlistPlayerService';

const player = PlaylistPlayerService.getInstance();

// Load and play
await player.loadPlaylist(playlist, songs);
await player.play();

// Control playback
await player.next();
await player.previous();
await player.pause();

// Toggle modes
player.toggleShuffle();
player.toggleRepeat();
```

#### Listening to Player State
```typescript
player.setCallbacks({
  onSongChange: (song, index) => {
    console.log(`Now playing: ${song.title}`);
  },
  onPlaylistEnd: () => {
    console.log('Playlist finished');
  },
  onStateChange: (state) => {
    console.log('Player state:', state);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Player error:', error);
  }
});
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### User Profiles
- Playlists are automatically scoped to user profiles
- Only the playlist owner can modify their playlists
- Playlist data is isolated per user

### Song Library
- Playlists reference existing songs by ID
- Song metadata is cached in playlist items
- Full song data is loaded on playback

### Multitrack Playback
- Playlist player integrates with existing audio system
- All tracks for a song play together
- Volume controls and muting work as expected

### Firebase Integration
- Real-time synchronization with Firebase
- Automatic updates when playlists change
- Offline capability (with Firebase offline persistence)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a playlist
- [ ] Add multiple songs to playlist
- [ ] Play a playlist
- [ ] Skip to next song
- [ ] Go back to previous song
- [ ] Remove a song from playlist
- [ ] Reorder songs in playlist
- [ ] Delete a playlist
- [ ] Test shuffle mode
- [ ] Test repeat mode
- [ ] Test with empty playlist
- [ ] Test with single song playlist

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty playlists (shows empty state)
- Single song playlists (no next/previous)
- Shuffle with one song (repeats if repeat enabled)
- Deleted songs in playlist (skipped gracefully)
- Network errors (error callbacks triggered)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Drag-and-drop reordering** in playlist UI
2. **Collaborative playlists** (shared with other users)
3. **Smart playlists** (auto-generated based on criteria)
4. **Playlist import/export** (share playlists as files)
5. **Play history** (track which songs played when)
6. **Playlist analytics** (most played, favorites)
7. **Crossfade between songs** (smooth transitions)
8. **Gapless playback** (no silence between songs)
9. **Playlist folders** (organize playlists)
10. **Recently played playlists** (quick access)

### UI Enhancements
1. Add playlist button to HomePage header
2. Mini player with current playlist info
3. Playlist progress indicator
4. Swipe gestures for song management
5. Search within playlist
6. Filter by artist/album

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Playlist not showing songs**
- Check that songs exist in Firebase database
- Verify song IDs in playlist match actual song IDs
- Check Firebase console for data

- Check network connection
- Verify audio permissions

**Songs not playing in order**
- Check if shuffle is enabled
- Verify position values in playlist items
- Check playlist player state

**Real-time updates not working**
- Verify Firebase Realtime Database rules
- Check authentication status
- Ensure listener is properly subscribed

## Deployment Notes

### Firebase Configuration
