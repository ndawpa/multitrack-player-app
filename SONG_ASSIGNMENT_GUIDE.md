## Best Practices

### 1. Organize by Purpose
- **Training Songs**: Assign to all relevant organizations
- **Department-Specific**: Only assign to that department
- **Executive Content**: Use private access for sensitive materials

### 2. Use Appropriate Access Levels
- **Public**: For content everyone should see
- **Private**: For content only specific people should see
- **Restricted**: For content requiring special permissions

### 3. Regular Review
- **Monthly**: Review song assignments
- **Remove**: Songs no longer relevant
- **Update**: Access levels as needed

### 4. Clear Naming
- **Descriptive titles**: Make it clear what the song is for
- **Organization tags**: Include department or purpose in the name
- **Version control**: Use version numbers for updated content

## User Experience

### What Users See
1. **Login** to the app
